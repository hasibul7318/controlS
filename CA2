\section{Introduction}
Introduction
Control systems are essential in various engineering applications, enabling automation, efficiency, and precision. These systems are broadly classified into open-loop and closed-loop systems, each with distinct characteristics and applications.

An open-loop system operates without feedback, meaning the output does not influence the input. These systems are simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement but lack accuracy and adaptability to external disturbances. Examples include washing machines, traffic light timers, and basic irrigation systems.

In contrast, a closed-loop system incorporates feedback, where the system continuously monitors its output and adjusts its input accordingly to achieve the desired performance. Such systems provide higher accuracy, stability, and robustness against disturbances. Common examples include air conditioning systems, automatic voltage regulators, and robotic arms.

To further enhance performance, controllers like PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers are used in closed-loop systems. These controllers improve system response by minimizing errors, reducing overshoot, and ensuring stability. However, the effectiveness of a control system depends on factors such as response time, error correction, and system dynamics.

This report aims to analyze and compare open-loop and closed-loop systems, both with and without controllers, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and real-world applications. Through theoretical analysis, experimental implementation, and performance evaluation, we seek to understand the significance of feedback and controllers in modern control systems.
